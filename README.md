# Ruby Fundamentals 1
## Bitmaker: Week 1

For the Tuesday assignment, we did four exercises on the fundamentals of Ruby.

1. Shows how to display to the commend line.
2. Shows how for string interpolation you can add varuables together and how logical statements works.
3. Get the users input, such as their name and age, then display them, to the screen.
4. Created a version of the FuzzBuzz exercise for Bitmaker, where numbers that can be divided by 3 will display Bit. For numbers that can be divided by 5 display Maker and for numbers that can be divided by both 3 & 5 display BitMaker.
